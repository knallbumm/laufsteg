## Installation

### Vanilla JS/TS

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add laufband

# npm
npm i laufband
```

#### CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/laufband"></script>
```

This exposes Laufband globally via `window.Laufband`

### React

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add @laufband/react

# npm
npm i @laufband/react
```

### Vue

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add @laufband/vue

# npm
npm i @laufband/vue
```

## Usage

The concrete usage depends on on the framework you are using.

For further information please have a look at the concrete adapters:

- [React](React)
- [Vue](Vue)

If you want to use Laufband without any framework, or want to write an adapter on your own, you only have to do two simple things:

### 1. Use this DOM Structure

```html
<div id="laufsteg-sample-1" className="laufsteg-container">
  <div className="laufsteg-trolley">
    <div className="laufsteg-cell">Your cell content goes here</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

There can be as many cells, as you want (with the same size). If there are not enough cells to fill the whole screen, Laufband will automatically duplicate cells.

### 2. Call `createLaufband()`

```ts
import { createLaufband } from 'laufband'
...
const options: LaufbandOptions = {...}
const container = document.getElementById("laufsteg-sample-1")
const laufband = createLaufband(container, options)
...
```

## Motivation

We were looking for a simple & performant libary for building endless carousels, but every libary we could find either focussed on very specific usecases, simply duplicated all the cells or simply felt not smooth enough.

The basic idea for this particular way of functioning of this Libary comes from a mentor of one of our team members.
